Section 55A (2) of Financial Services & Markets Act (â€˜FSMAâ€™) stipulates that an application is made to the PRA if the regulated activities to which the application relates consist of or include a PRA-regulated activity. The authorisation of a bank is dependent on that entity undertaking the regulated activity of deposit-taking, which is designated as a PRA regulated activity under the secondary legislation of section 2 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (PRA-regulated Activities) Order 2013 (â€˜RAOâ€™). The PRA is required to seek the consent of the FCA before an applicant can be authorised. Once authorised, the firm will then have a Part 4A permission (granted under the powers spelt out in Part 4a of FSMA, so hence known as a â€˜Part 4a permissionâ€™) to carry on regulated activities. The assessment criteria are both regulatorsâ€™ Threshold Conditions, which consider such topics as adequate financial and non-financial resources. Underpinning these Conditions are European legislation. For banks, in particular meeting the Capital Requirements Regulations (â€˜CRRâ€™) is also important. _x000D_\nThe exception to this is EEA banks that operate in the UK through a branch or on a cross border basis and whose home regulator is in another EEA state.

    "target": "1)\tAn asset, including a leased asset, becomes non-Â¬ performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank. Banks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three categories based on the period for which the asset has remained non-Â¬ performing and the realisability of the dues: I. SubÂ¬standard Assets: A subÂ¬standard asset would be one, which has remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months. Such an asset will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected. II. Doubtful Assets: An asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained in the subÂ¬standard category for a period of 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in assets that were classified as sub-standard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, â€“ on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values â€“ highly questionable and improbable. III. Loss Assets: A loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or the RBI inspection but the amount has not been written off wholly.

The Federal Law No. 175-FZ of October 27, 2008 on Additional Measures for Enhancing the Stability of the Banking System in the Period Until December 31, 2014 stipulates that for the purpose of supporting the stability of the banking system and protecting the lawful interests of banks' depositors and creditors if there are signs of the unstable financial state of banks or situations are discovered that threaten the stability of the banking system and the lawful interests of banks' depositors and creditors the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) and the state corporation \"Deposit Insurance Agency\" (DIA) are entitled to take measures for preventing the bankruptcy of the banks participating in the system of compulsory insurance of natural persons' deposits in the banks of the Russian Federation.\n2.1. The Federal Law No. 432-FZ of December 22, 2014 on Amending Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation and Declaring Invalidated Certain Legislative Acts (Provisions of Legislative Acts) of the Russian Federation has updated the banking legislation (including the Bankruptcy Law No. 127-FZ), to introduce a more comprehensive legal framework with regard to resolving failing banks, including both measures to prevent insolvencies (bankruptcies) of credit institutions and procedures for declaring credit institutions insolvent (bankrupt) and subsequently liquidating them â€“ with the participation of the DIA.\nThe 2014 law enables the bailing-in of subordinated creditors through write-off or conversion of their debt into bank shares.\n2.2. The Federal Law No. 84-FZ of May 1, 2017 on Amending Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation:\n- provides that financial resources of the fund created by the CBR are exercised to provide direct capital injections into problematic banks instead of DIAâ€™s resolution mechanisms and CBRâ€™s loans. A stake in the bank acquired for account of the fund will be sold to third-party investor in a public auction upon successful completion of a bankâ€™s financial rehabilitation. The new framework enables the central bank to assume control over DIAâ€™s bank resolution activities by taking over a majority of seats on DIAâ€™s Board of Directors (the Russian government holds the majority at present).\n- stipulates a new condition of CBRâ€™s financial aid. It implies termination of obligations to the top management of the bank, as well as to bank controlling persons, possessing 20% or more of stakes for the last 3 years.",

The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) does not take part in the SNDC.

    "target": "There is currently no single agency responsible for consumer protection in respect of banking conduct, but that it is currently split between three different agencies, viz: (i) The Consumer Commission, our general consumer protection agency; (ii) The National Credit Regulator, in relation to credit extension to consumers; and (iii) the FSB through the FAIS Act, in relation to advice and intermediary services on bank products. Banks are also subject to the consumer protection requirements of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, in so far as it provides financial advisory and intermediary services.On 1 April 2011, Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2009, (The CPA) came into effect. The object of the act is among others, to promote a fair, accessible and sustainable marketplace for consumer products and services and for that purpose to establish national norms and standards relating to consumer protection, to provide for improved standards of consumer information, to prohibit certain unfair marketing and business practices, to promote responsible consumer behaviour, to promote a consistent legislative and enforcement framework relating to consumer transactions and agreements, to establish the National Consumer Commission. The CPAâ€™s definition of â€œserviceâ€ includes, but is not limited to-_x000D_\nany banking services, or related or similar financial services, or the undertaking, underwriting or assumption of any risk by one person on behalf of another, except to the extent that any such service-_x000D_\nconstitutes advice or intermediary services that is subject to regulation in terms of the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002 (Act No. 37 of 2002) (FAIS Act) ; or is regulated in terms of the Long-term Insurance Act, 1998 (Act No. 52 of 1998), or the Short-term Insurance Act, 1998 (Act No. 53 of 1998). The FAIS Act and the Insurance Acts are supervised by the Financial Services Board. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe National Credit Regulator (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The NCA) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The National Consumer Tribunal is an independent adjudicative entity, deriving its mandate from the National Credit Act (NCA). The Tribunal has powers to, inter alia, impose administrative fines, require repayment of excess charges etc. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe Banking Association of South Africa developed the Banking Code to which all members (banks) must adhere. The Code is a voluntary code that sets out the minimum standards for service and conduct a financial customer can expect from a bank with regard to the services and products it offers. _x000D_\n_x000D_\nBAnks that are members of the Banking Association are also subject to the jurisdiction of the Ombudman for Banking Services (OBS) . Any bank customer may lodge a complaint against his or her bank with the OBS, provided the OBS has jurisdiction._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe FAIS Ombud deals with consumer complaints against Financial Servicve Providers (including banks) and provides an efficient and affordable dispute resolution mechanism. The Office of the Ombud for Financial Services Providers became mandated on_x000D_\n30 September 2004 to accepting and dealing with complaints. The Ombudâ€™s determinations are binding and may include payment of monetary awards, damages and costs with interest._x000D_\n_x000D_\nIn terms of the proposed Twin Peak model of financial regulation. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority will be responsible for, inter alia, the protection of financial customers by promoting fair treatment of financial customers by financial institutions (including banks) and providing financial customers with financial education programmes and otherwise promoting financial literacy and the ability of financial customers and potential financial customers to make sound financial decisions._x000D_",
